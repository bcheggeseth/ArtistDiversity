## Survey Instrument

We are interested in gathering information about artists. Immediately below, you will see the name of an artist, a website link
pointing to information about the artist and/or a sample of their work, and the name of a museum in which the artist’s work is
displayed.
- Artist [NAME OF ARTIST]
- Webpage [URL]
- Museum [NAME OF MUSEUM]

We ask you to find information about the artist above and to make your best inference about their gender, ethnicity, national
origin, and birth year. To find this information, you might use:
- the information linked above (you may need to cut and paste the link into your web browser)
- other links you find on that webpage
- Wikipedia
- Google searches
- any other resources you find helpful

In addition to answering questions about the artist’s gender, ethnicity, national origin, and birth year, you will have a chance
to express your degree of confidence for each response you give (for example, "I am somewhat confident in my assessment of
this artist’s gender")

offered below.)

2. What is the gender of the artist? In answering this question, you might use the artist?s name, and/or any pictures you

or because a person has physical, cultural or linguistic characteristics of a national origin group. What one country is
your best assessment of the artist’s national origin? If the country no longer exists, please use your best judgment to pick
a currently existing country that is as geographically close as possible. For instance, for an artist with national origin
“Ottoman Empire,” you might choose “Turkey,” or “Syria,” or “Iraq.” If the artist is not a unique, identifiable individual,
please choose the first option below. If you could not determine the artist’s primary national origin, please choose the

an artist’s birth year is BC/BCE, please enter it the number with a minus sign before it. For example, if an artist’s birth
year were 145 BC, you would enter -145. In your response, please only enter numbers (potentially with a minus sign), but
no words or other text. Finally, if the artist was not a unique, identifiable individual or if you cannot determine the
